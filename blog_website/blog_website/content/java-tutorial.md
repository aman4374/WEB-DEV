# Java Tutorial: From Basics to Advanced Concepts

Welcome to this comprehensive Java tutorial! Whether you're a beginner in programming or looking to enhance your Java skills, this guide will take you through the fundamentals of Java and introduce you to more advanced concepts as you progress.

## Introduction to Java

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability. It's widely used for developing enterprise-level applications, Android apps, and large-scale web applications.

### Why Learn Java?

- **Popularity**: Java consistently ranks among the top programming languages in use worldwide.
- **Versatility**: It's used in various domains, from web development to mobile apps and enterprise software.
- **Strong Community**: Java has a vast community, offering extensive resources and support.
- **Career Opportunities**: Java developers are in high demand across various industries.

## Setting Up Your Java Development Environment

To start coding in Java, you'll need to set up your development environment:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Download and install the latest version from Oracle's website or use OpenJDK.
2. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Popular options include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
3. **Set up your PATH environment variable**: This allows you to run Java from any directory in your command line.

## Java Basics

Let's start with the fundamentals of Java programming:

### Hello World Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Variables and Data Types

Java is a statically-typed language, which means you need to declare the type of a variable before using it.

```java
int age = 25;
double height = 5.9;
String name = "John Doe";
boolean isStudent = true;
```

### Control Structures

Java supports various control structures for decision-making and looping:

```java
// If-else statement
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor");
}

// For loop
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}

// While loop
int count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    count++;
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Java is fundamentally an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Let's explore some key OOP concepts:

### Classes and Objects

```java
public class Car {
    String brand;
    String model;
    int year;

    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("The " + brand + " " + model + " is starting...");
    }
}

// Creating an object
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.model = "Corolla";
myCar.year = 2022;
myCar.startEngine();
```

### Inheritance

```java
public class ElectricCar extends Car {
    int batteryCapacity;

    public void charge() {
        System.out.println("Charging the electric car...");
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism

```java
public class Vehicle {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is moving");
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Boat extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Boat is sailing");
    }
}
```

## Advanced Java Concepts

As you become more comfortable with Java basics, you can explore more advanced topics:

### Exception Handling

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always executes");
}
```

### Collections Framework

```java
import java.util.*;

List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Alice");
names.add("Bob");

Map<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<>();
ages.put("Alice", 30);
ages.put("Bob", 25);
```

### Multithreading

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();
```

### Lambda Expressions (Java 8+)

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations on making it through this Java tutorial! You've covered everything from basic syntax to advanced concepts like multithreading and lambda expressions. Keep practicing and exploring Java's vast ecosystem to enhance your programming skills.

Remember, the best way to learn Java is by writing code. Start with small projects and gradually take on more complex challenges. Happy coding!
